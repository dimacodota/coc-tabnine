# coc-tabnine

Fork of [tabnine-vscode](https://github.com/zxqfl/tabnine-vscode)

This is the [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) client for [TabNine](https://tabnine.com), the all-language autocompleter.

- Indexes your whole project, reading your .gitignore to determine which files to index.
- Type long variable names in just a few keystrokes using the mnemonic completion engine.
- Zero configuration. TabNine works out of the box.
- Highly responsive: typically produces a list of suggestions in less than 10 milliseconds.

Many users choose to disable the default behavior of using Enter to accept completions, to avoid accepting a completion when they intended to start a new line. You can do this by going to _Settings â†’ Editor: Accept Suggestion On Enter_ and setting it to _off_.
